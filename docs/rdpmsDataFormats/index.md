## Introduction

The RDPMS (Remote Diagnostic Predictive Maintenance Solutions) system utilizes specific payload formats to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficiency in data processing and management. This documentation outlines these formats and provides guidelines for their usage.

## Payload Specifications

### Diagnostic Payloads

Details about the structure and content of diagnostic payloads.

### Predictive Maintenance Payloads

Details about the structure and content of predictive maintenance payloads.

### Alert Payloads

Details about the structure and content of alert payloads.

## Examples

### Diagnostic Payload Example

```json
{
    "deviceId": "12345",
    "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "diagnosticData": {
        "temperature": 75,
        "vibration": 0.02
    }
}
```

### Predictive Maintenance Payload Example

```json
{
    "deviceId": "12345",
    "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "maintenancePrediction": {
        "component": "motor",
        "predictedFailureDate": "2023-12-01"
    }
}
```

### Alert Payload Example

```json
{
    "deviceId": "12345",
    "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "alertType": "temperature",
    "alertLevel": "high"
}
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure data consistency by adhering to the specified payload formats.
- Validate payloads to prevent errors during processing.
- Use appropriate data types for each field.
